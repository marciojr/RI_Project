G105 features LED backlighting that can be set at two different levels, or turned off all together. G105 includes six programmable G-keys that make complex actions simple. Three separate modes deliver access to a total of 18 unique functions and macro combinations quickly and consistently. With G-keys, instant access to a variety of customizable functions is just a click away. Assign a G-key to open microphone channels and talk to friends through Ventrilo or to record your play on the fly. Assign a G-key to send predetermined text messages to your team. You can even program G-keys to interact with your Logitech G mouse to change DPI levels on the fly. During the heat of battle, there are times when you might need to simultaneously run, strafe, select a weapon and open a door. Multi-key input on G105 means complex moves are executed exactly right every time. Press up to six keys at once, each registered perfectly. And the anti-ghosting means you never need to see a command you didn't intend. You're about to record a record high number of perfect headshots when an accidental keystroke sends you on an unplanned and unwanted trip to your desktop. Don't let this kind of mistake ruin your streak or your game - easily disable the Windows key with one button so your game won't be interrupted. You can thank us later.

Rated 5 out of 5 by defalt from very cool design, high performance with one flaw I got this for my bday over all very nice lights are very bright can see perfectly at night the gkeys work nice u need to download the Logitech gaming software to program the g keys it feels nice on ur fingers the weight is not to heavy and or light but the one flaw is I'm not sure if the g keys will work on kali Linux and the cord is not meant for a laptop its more for a desktop but it works perfectly with my HP laptop overall 5 out 5 stars really nice design,feeling, and spacing.
