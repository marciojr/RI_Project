Rated 4 out of 5 by Video game88 from The boys are back in town I got this game and I probably know I would like it and I do. We got Road To The Show and season and that is all I need but there are other modes too. Buy! Date published: 2017-05-08 Rated 4 out of 5 by MatthewTheGamer52 from Great game -- needs improvements MLB The Show games are great. This one is no exception. This game is great for everyone who enjoys baseball. However, there are some game modes that need improvement. For example, the FRANCHISE mode needs a little bit more improvement. They're needs to be more things to do. In addition, there is no personalization to your character in franchise mode. I'd like to see that you can actually name your GM (much like in NBA 2K17). If you play it for a long time, like me, it becomes boring because you constantly have to do the same thing over and over and over. On the other side, Road To The Show mode is great. There is a storyline -- and it is based all on you answer questions your coach or whoever asks. It's a great improvement. I definitely recommend this game for all baseball fans!

Date published: 2017-04-24 Rated 5 out of 5 by Tonyajp12 from 10/10 must have I hated the old road to the show but now it is amazing I played it for two hours straight it's just to good. Date published: 2017-04-24 Rated 1 out of 5 by Jsoll8 from Terribly momentum based Huge baseball fan and an avid player of The Show. This game is terrible. You can be playing someone online who is using pure analog to hit and then when you take an 8-0 lead they can switch to X and start hitting pitches they were whiffing at all game. Must update and have lobbies specific to hitting style. Otherwise I will never play again. Date published: 2017-04-18 Rated 4 out of 5 by Videoguy88 from The Boys of Summer are back! I pre ordered this game and picked it up and was ready to play. This game is much harder then I thought. Hitting is a challenge. Pitching not do much but they will take you deep if you throw a pitch they can hit. Fielding isn't bad at all. Road to the show is the same with just a little tweak. I won't say what it is. Overall great baseball game⚾️.
