EPIC, CINEMATIC STORYLINE Injustice 2 continues the story set in motion in Injustice: Gods Among Us as Batman and his allies work towards putting the pieces of society back together, but struggle against those who would restore Superman's Regime. In the midst of this chaos, a new threat appears that will put Earth's very existence at risk. BUILT BY NETHERREALM STUDIOS Developers of the best-selling and critically acclaimed Mortal Kombat franchise, NetherRealm Studios brings unrivaled storytelling, robust content, and best-in-class fighting mechanics to the DC Universe. CHARACTERS BATMAN "THERE ARE LINES WE DON'T CROSS." Even after he's been exposed to the world as Batman, Bruce Wayne keeps his vow to avenge his parents' death by fighting for justice. He refuses to execute his enemies, believing that once he crosses that line, he's no better than the cowards he battles. SUPERMAN "THE WORLD'S CHANGED SINCE METROPOLIS." After the fall of the Regime, Superman now remains a permanent resident of a prison built to contain and suppress the man of steel. Still grieving the loss of Lois and their unborn son, Superman maintains that peace can only be achieved through subjugation -- But as a new threat looms, can old enemies forge new alliances? WONDER WOMAN "DID I MENTION I'M AN AMAZON!" An exiled sister of Themyscira, Wonder Woman remains in hiding after the fall of the Regime. Still an ardent believer of Superman and his rule, Wonder Woman awaits her opportunity to strike back against Batman and free Superman from his imprisonment. SUPERGIRL "I PUNCH ABOVE MY WEIGHT." As a child Kara Zor-El witnessed the devastation of Krypton before she was sent to Earth on a mission to protect her infant cousin, Kal-El. Arriving on Earth decades too late, she discovered that grown-up Kal has been imprisoned. Still determined to protect her family, and its legacy, Kara will fight her cousin's enemies as Supergirl. AQUAMAN "MY DUTY IS TO ATLANTIS." The Atlantean ruler has isolated his kingdom from the surface world's affairs after a punishing defeat during the fall of Superman's Regime. However his determination to keep Atlantis' independence may cost him, as new threats rise can Aquaman swallow his pride to protect his people? ATROCITUS "OUR HELLISH HATE WILL BURN YOU ALL!" Red Lantern Atrocitus seeks revenge against all members of the Sinestro Corps for their murderous oppression of his homeworld. His hate blazes a path across the galaxy leading him to Earth. Sensing an opportunity on the post Regime planet, Atrocitus focuses on bolstering the Red Lanterns ranks by stoking the flames of rage. GORILLA GRODD "GIVE INTO GRODD!" Telepathic brute, Gorilla Grodd, has long sought to prove his peerless genius by subjugating mankind. He's gone so far as to form an anti-Justice League, the Society, to once and for all smash their opposition. Using his intellect and telepathy Grodd enlists others in his mission to conquer the planet and fill void of power left by Superman's Regime. DEADSHOT "GOOD THING WE'RE PROFESSIONALS." Floyd Lawton is "the" human arsenal, his aim lethal from any range. Having escaped imprisonment during the Regime, he now enters the fray as an expert assassin for hire, forced to contend with the fact that Grodd has come into possession of the detonator to the Personal Explosive Device implanted in his head. HARLEY QUINN "READY FOR SOME SLAPSTICK?" Since the fall of the Regime, Harley Quinn has found little solace in the incarceration of Superman. Still feeling a tremendous void left by Joker's death, Harley remains an unstable and uneasy ally. Resolute in her conviction, she refuses to let fugitives, assassins, or even criminals she once called friends stand in the way of her exacting revenge upon the man who silenced the Joker's laugh. THE FLASH "ALL DAY I'VE BEEN REMINDED HOW I FAILED TO BE A HERO." Once known as the fastest man alive, Barry Allen has hung up his boots in public shame after defecting from the Regime. However as a new enemy threatens the innocent, the Flash returns to action, determined to redeem himself. BLUE BEETLE "I'M READY TO LEVEL UP." Jaime Reyes sought Batman's help in learning to use the Scarab, an alien weapon of mass destruction bonded to his spine. Although the Scarab could pose a deadly threat to the entire planet, kindhearted Jaime is determined to protect people, wary of the corruptive influence of great power he witnessed under the Regime. BANE "HATE IS THE PERENNIAL MOTIVATOR." After Superman's defeat, Bane was betrayed by the Regime and relentlessly pursued by Batman. Having already spent most of his life in prison, he is determined to take revenge against his former Regime masters and turn Gotham into a city where his rule is law. POISON IVY "I HAVE NO MORE FRIENDS, ALL I HAVE IS THE GREEN." Dr. Pamela Isley was once an innovative, radical botanical biochemist with a singular goal: make the world safe for plant life to flourish. She joins the Society to further their common interest in bringing mankind to its knees, but at heart, Ivy's desire is to ensure that in any new world order, flora dominates fauna. And more...
