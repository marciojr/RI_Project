Rated 4 out of 5 by Kevin2017 from Great Game! I bought Ghost Recon Wildlands the week it was released after seeing the E3 demo the year before. The concept of a strategic military shooter juxtaposed to all of the Call of Duty clones out there these days really interested me. After having played it for a few weeks, I would definitely recommend it! The gameplay is on point, the squad based combat is excellent, particularly with multiplayer, and the map is enormous and simply gorgeous. There is most certainly an RPG element to the game once you become engrossed in it, and for the most part you are able to do whatever you want in whatever order you see fit, giving YOU full control over YOUR experience. The game is not without its faults however, as the missions are sometimes repetitive, the story is disjointed at times due to the sheer size of the game, and there are bugs galore, the vast majority of them being funny and not game breaking in the slightest. But overall, Ghost Recon Wildlands is a great game and is an exciting proof of concept for things to come from the Tom Clancy franchise. Date published: 2017-05-06 Rated 5 out of 5 by Here from Fun different Fun way to spend time. The interface is smooth and easy to use Date published: 2017-04-24 Rated 4 out of 5 by NewborRiddler from Destroying from the inside. This game was across the board pretty fun, especially with friends as the AI partners are not exactly the brightest. First off when playing this game you need to look at it as more of a military simulator than trying to be an open-world RPG style of game play. Missions do become repetitive and you do have to do a lot of Intel gathering, but hey that's how it's done in the real world, we don't just know where the bad guys are. Between gathering new weapons and attachments with a minor upgrading system for your character this game is a solid shooter as of late. The story line isn't bad, but isn't the best either. The dialogue get's really corny sometimes and other times have a "military sense of humor". The graphics look good for an open world style game and the how the weapons feel actually make you have to think about your attack instead of just running in and shooting up the place. Attachments give different properties to your weapons and things such as suppressors actually lower the damage, range and penetration of your weapon. So in turn you find yourself weighing your options and trying to find the best weapon and attachments for the job that is needed. I have to say there was a great feeling after taking down an entire compound without setting off any alarms or anything. This game is a good pick up if you're a fan of Tom Clancy, military or shooters in general. Don't expect a masterpiece, but I can at least say this was a better fit than The Division as the enemies in this are not bullet sponges.
