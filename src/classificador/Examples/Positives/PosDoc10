Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the city's network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy...and more. Use the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge. Game Overview Set in Chicago, where a central network of computers connects everyone and everything, Watch_Dogs explores the impact of technology within our society. Using the city as your weapon, you will embark on a personal mission to inflict your own brand of justice. Chicago's overarching network is known as the Central Operating System (ctOS), and it controls almost all of the city's technology and information - including key data on all of the city's residents. You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. While seeking justice for those events, you'll monitor and hack those around you by manipulating the ctOS from the palm of your hand. You'll access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy... and more. The City is Our Weapon Watch_Dogs takes place in a fully simulated living city. Using Aiden's smartphone, you have real-time control over the city's infrastructure. Trap your enemy in a 30-car pileup by manipulating the traffic lights. Stop a train, and then board it to evade the authorities. Narrowly escape capture by quickly raising a drawbridge. Anything connected to the ctOS can become your weapon. Street Justice Living in inner city Chicago, where violence is often answered by violence, Aiden has learned how to take the fight to the streets. Deliver devastating blows with your baton, or experience electrifying shoot-outs with physics simulation that rivals anything in the shooter category. Throughout his journey, Aiden will take on his foes with more than 30 traditional weapons. High Octane Driving Luckily, Aiden won't always need to traverse Chicago's streets on foot. Ubisoft Montreal has partnered with studios such as Ubisoft Reflections, the acclaimed team behind the award-winning Driver series, to provide a suite of vehicles bursting with horsepower. You'll get behind the wheel of more than 65 cars - each with state-of-the-art physics and handling - to explore Chicago's vast and intricate roadways. Everything is Under Control Disrupt, the all-new game engine powering Watch_Dogs, uses advanced processing to deliver stunning visuals and an incredibly immersive world. Dynamic Navigation Not only does Watch_Dogs give you the ability to take advantage of the ctOS, it also allows you to explore the many layers of Chicago itself. Cut through buildings, scale rooftops, and explore the city's dangerous underground to catch your target. Characters Aiden Pearce You are Aiden Pearce, a man shaped by violence and obsessed with surveillance, who monitors his family 24/7 in secret to protect them from something that happened in the past. Unfortunately, his family will get endangered once again. Pushed to his limits, he will take justice into his own hands and confront a corrupt system using every weapon available to him. Aiden will become a modern Vigilante Hero - not a hero from the 70's with a cape, but a real human being that will deal with all the repercussions of his actions. Clara Lille Clara is seductive. She's dangerous. She's the trapdoor spider you never saw living right under you. She can weave her way through any system and she can expose every secret you hide. Jordi Chin When you're screwed beyond belief, you call in a fixer. And that's Jordi. He gets things done and gets paid good money for his services. You need a body to disappear? You gotta find a missing adversary? Someone pissed you off? You call Jordi. ctOS The ctOS is an efficient system linking all the city's infrastructure and public security installations to one centralized hub. This system focuses on traffic efficiency, eco-development, tele-communications, and crime control throughout Chicago. It has brought notable benefits to citizens, including shorter commutes, lowered crime rates, a cleaner city, and much more. Chicago Watch_Dogs takes place in a contemporary Chicago that's been enhanced and transformed by the ctOS. In this version of Chicago, everything is connected. Banks, security systems, communication hubs, and even the city's basic infrastructure operate via the this connected network. The ctOS provides a new take on one of the world's great cities, and it's this omniscient setting that serves as the backdrop for Aiden's story.

Rated 2 out of 5 by TyroneSlothrop from It's a dog, all right Silly me, I have this notion that games ought to be fun. Watch Dogs is just a pain in the posterior from beginning to end. I don't mind a challenge-- I've been playing computer games of one kind or another for thirty years. Along with the hard parts, a good game throws you a bone every now and then. Watch Dogs never does. Every tiny task is annoyingly hard. Worst of all are the car chase tasks. Who has time to spend four hours on a nearly impossible side task that doesn't provide any rewards or advance the plot? Don't waste your money on this loser unless you're a masochist. Date published: 2016-06-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by TheRealVigilante from Awesome Great game All around it has a nice campaign, and a great multiplayer combined with outstanding graphics! Date published: 2016-05-17 Rated 4 out of 5 by GM032 from Really Good Game Watch Dogs is a really fun game to really do some crazy stuff beyonds the limits! You can hack in too mostly anything. That's the fun part about it. Really recommend this game. You should go and pick it up and try it. Date published: 2016-05-08 Rated 4 out of 5 by KyleFL from NOT BAD AT ALL!!! People kept saying its a terrible game so i didn't buy it until now and let me say great deal for a good game so i recommend it. Date published: 2016-01-19 Rated 4 out of 5 by notboblevy from Pretty good I viewed many reviews before playing this game and found it a little better than I had anticipated form the reviews. The driving in this game SUCKS, but outside of that other gameplay was refined and interesting. The profiler is unique and adds to the lasting appeal. Some of the side missions were boring and very repetitive but I did find myself completing all of them except for the convoy and fixer missions, which I REALLY found repetitive, sort of like this sentence. I would recommend it and don't expect it to be just like other open world games, which I found was a good thing. The water workaround was pretty much a unlocked cheat but for the last mission you almost need it. Date published: 2015-08-29 Rated 3 out of 5 by Vetrex from Watch_Dogs What is Watch Dogs? After being showcased at E3, and everyone's minds being consecutively blown, the game is finally out. How is it? Terrible. I've spent awhile trying to think of a single good thing about Watch Dogs, but I just can't. The driving is bad, so much so that I would rather play Grand Theft Auto 4 (a game with really weak driving) or even Saints Row 4 (a game with tacked on driving). The handling feels terrible, and its a chore to drive (not good in an open world game with cars as the main prospect of travel). The gunplay is even worse. Shooting feels stiff, unchallenging, and unsatisfying. When you shoot in a game, you should feel powerful. In Watch Dogs, I just feel like I'm shooting a nicely skinned Nerf Gun. Hacking is over-simplistic where most of the time it's just hitting 'X' and something happens. The open world is boring, dull, uninteresting where the only thing happening is popping up your phone so you can listen on people's conversations, see criminal records, and personal information. If you want see examples of good open worlds see: Witcher 3 or Grand Theft Auto 5 (just to name a few). The game is looks utterly uninspired. I'm not speaking of the clear downgrade in visual fidelity from E3. The game just looks about as fun as it is to play. Chicago is a boring landscape to look at in Watch Dogs, I have no interest in actually going there because this game does absolutely no justice for it. Lighting is pretty good at night (to be fair), but other than that the game looks dull, and looks like it came from the early PS3/360 days (and this is on current gen hardware). Multiplayer is empty on the Xbox One, hardly anyone ever plays it. But when you do get in a game, you're met with a long list of technical issues including a steady sub 20 frames, extremely terrible lag, and sometimes even hard crashing (note that this game also came out on 360/PS3, and I played on a Xbox One so there problems might even be worse on the 360/PS3). The story..is bland. It tries to teach you something with its message, but ultimately contradicts itself with gameplay, and its uninteresting main character. Digital trips are a feature where you can take 'digital drugs' and trip and have some wacky adventures! Sound like fun? Too bad, it's nothing more than to compete with Saints Row 4's wacky activities. The Spider Tank is simply destroy this, destroy that. The Psychodelic trip is bouncing from flower to flower (which wasn't even fun the first time, let alone the 17 times you had to do it to be rewarded). The other two aren't even worth mentioning. In the end, Watch Dogs tries to be another great open world game, but doesn't do enough with its own ideas to be even noteworthy. Instead it would rather compete with the other great open world games by sloppily trying to mimic them, but its too busy rolling around in its own mediocrity to be as good as the other games. So Watch Dogs can be summed up as a Sloppy GTA V/SR4 clone, seeing as everything done in it was pretty sloppy. Date published: 2015-07-13 Rated 3 out of 5 by Mydogswatchin from ehh I bought Watch Dogs in June, 2014. After a month of hearing that it was good, bad, good, bad, I got the game. I hated it after I played it for like a month, so I uninstalled it on my Xbox. About a year later, my friend got it for his birthday along with an Xbox One, so I installed the game again. I loved the game much more when I was playing with my friend on the Xbox One for the first time. Then, today when I finished a mission, I lost all of my skills from the Skills Tree thing. I worked so hard to get all of those skills. I even lost the beginners kit which you get from the first mission of the game, and I can't buy the skill. So hacking, which is the biggest part of the game, is off my Watch Dogs smart phone. It was a good game until that glitch. I recommend you buy the game, but beware of the crazy glitches that aren't funny at all. Date published: 2015-07-02 Rated 3 out of 5 by Zahl from Overhyped into Failure I'll start with the good: This game is beautiful! Though it looks much better on PC it's still a very pretty game and has a lot of complex details that make every little thing a lot better. There are a lot of complex things you can do as a hacker... Which brings me to the bad stuff. It's nearly impossible to execute the advanced controls on side missions or when you're just messing around. The main story has every cool aspect of this game and quite frankly the story stinks. I would not recommend this game. You're better off playing Assassin's Creed or Grand Theft Auto for whichever aspect of this game that you seek.
