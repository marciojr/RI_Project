Recommended for You Rated 5 out of 5 by CrazyCurry from the game was really fun,so check it out This game is the best game i have ever played in my entire life.i remember when it first came out,i was only 5yrs old at the time and i had a gameboy color that i got that recent yr. Date published: 2016-11-28 Rated 4 out of 5 by NewbornRiddler from Keeping classics going! While I started on Pokemon Blue as a child, this was the next best thing. Following the show, now known as Indigo League, we finally got to start with Pikachu while obtaining the other starters. The game plays almost exactly like Red and Blue with the added bonus of getting all the starters, having Pikachu following you around and so on. So if you're like me and grew up with the original 151 this is something you have to pick-up especially for only $10. Granted while this might be a "downgrade" to what a lot of fans are used too today, its a classic and worthy of any Pokemon fan's time. Date published: 2016-08-24 Rated 5 out of 5 by barmuffin from BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!! BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its just like the tv show as you play as Ash with Pikkachu by your side fighting team rocket and capturing every pokemon you can. Date published: 2016-08-08 Rated 5 out of 5 by Mask from The 90's are Back! Since this game has returned Childhood memories have also returned! But this time Pokemon can go with you into Gen 7! So an Old team remade on Yellow will have the travel of a lifetime! Date published: 2016-08-05 Rated 5 out of 5 by Marsgirl26 from 17 years later and still holds up! I remember playing this game back when I got my first Gameboy Color 14 years ago as a birthday gift from my mother. This game was the first Pokemon game I played and I must say I was impressed! Pikachu is one of my favorite Pokemon and is a must-play for gamers who love Pokemon, especially if you're an O.G. like me! Plus I like how Jesse & James make their debut appearance as one of the antagonists besides your rival Gary (or Blue if you want to be OCD about it). The graphics and sound may not be the best, but overall the gameplay is awesome! Date published: 2016-05-23 Rated 4 out of 5 by sportfan15 from Pika! This game was huge when it came out the first time. Now we can all re live the moments we all had with this game. It looks like it did back then which makes it real and not fake. It is not bad cause it Pokemon. The game is really most ways. Check it out. Date published: 2016-03-11 Rated 3 out of 5 by t1d1o1g44 from Reliving my childhood. I'd be very happy to play this if Gamestop would give out the code for it. I pre-ordered this back in January and I haven't gotten the code yet to be able to play this. I want to play Yellow very much but I'm not paying twice for a single game within two months or whatever. :/ Again. Want to travel Kanto. Beat my rival. Collect gym badges. Have my good buddy Pikachu with me. Then take on the Elite Four. Along with catching and trading Pokemon of course. Now without a link cable. And this choosing a nickname this is really irritating. Having to make one up is such a hassle when one could use their own without the silly requirements and the one they want to use is already taken. -__- Date published: 2016-02-27 Rated 5 out of 5 by Lifelesslump from reliving my childhood all for $10, DEAL! I have beaten Blue version countless times on my purple gameboy color. I borrowed yellow version from a friend, beat that a few times too. I got yellow version to beat it many times more. And I own all the other pokemon generations, but nothing can compare to the 1st Gen!
