Some have given us shout-outs for honest communication (thanks, we try!) and others feel we still have a lot of work to do (we’re fully aware and are already on it!). A third group have provided very clear and useful suggestions on how to improve the first paid DLC, ‘Tents and Ground Blinds’. With this note, we’d like to talk about some adjustments which we hope will be welcome, regardless of which of the above groups you belong to. Here’s what we’re doing, and why: You’ve let us know that it takes too much work to earn Tents and Ground Blinds in the game, once you’ve bought the DLC. With today’s adjustment, we are lowering the price in the in-game store to 16.000 for Tents and 8.000 for Ground Blinds, compared to the previous price point of 24.000 and 12.000 respectively, to make sure you can fully enjoy you new equipment once you’ve purchased the DLC. In the near future, we are planning to increase the amount of Tents and Ground Blinds that you get right away when purchasing the DLC, from one of each, to 5 Tents and 5 Ground Blinds. We don’t have an ETA yet, but the Development Team is working on this right now. Players who bought Tents and/or Ground Blinds before this in-game price reduction will be refunded for spent in-game currency, corresponding to a maximum of 5 Tents and 5 Ground Blinds. We want to encourage our most avid hunters, after all! While we’re doing this work, we’re also looking into reported issues including Tents and Ground Blinds sometimes disappear from the inventory and storage after dismantling them. We hope you’ll enjoy these fixes and tweaks. Please let us know what you think in the comments below the announcement or in the dedicated forum thread Lastly today, we know that many of you are requesting general bug fixes and improvements, and that work is indeed ongoing. We’ll share more about upcoming patches and their content as we finalize them. Happy hunting! theHunter: Call of the Wild Support Team 77 comments Read more 9 May THEHUNTER: COTW - The Hunting Lodge live stream Hello Hunters, Today we are taking a closer look at the new ground blinds and test them inside out.
