Rated 5 out of 5 by Jesse Gerald from Grand theft auto Date published: 2017-04-27 Rated 4 out of 5 by Clancy from Great for people who don't have $60 to shell out I understand that the 1 year subscription saves you money then buying four of the 3 month subscriptions however it's just easier to save $25 then $60. They need to add more games for the memberships overall. Sony is giving more games out for getting the subscription. I hate that Microsoft gives out 2 a month and they usually stink I mean do we get any input on which games we would like ? Date published: 2015-07-07 Rated 1 out of 5 by Handmeoverthathamburger from Stinks Dont Get It It stinks when i sratched the code so i could see there was a missing letter so i wasted 25 dollers it stinks dont get it i mean dont get it Date published: 2015-01-28 Rated 1 out of 5 by Suzuki615 from Make an Account Don't buy this as a guest. Make an account so it will be sent to your order history where you can download the code. Date published: 2015-01-04 Rated 2 out of 5 by JoshoC from Poor Service Bought this online thinking the code would be available immediately… guess I was poorly mistaken. FAQ's say that if the code is not shown right away an email within an hour will have the code, but this was also wrong. I could have just gone to the store and got one if I knew it wouldn't be immediate.
