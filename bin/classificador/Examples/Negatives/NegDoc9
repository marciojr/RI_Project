There were no scratches on the screen, which was one of the things I was worried about. The 3 games that came with the 3DS seemed new and worked fine. For the price, it was a good deal. Date published: 2017-01-30 Rated 4 out of 5 by terror23 from This was a pretty good buy! The back panel of the 3DS shifts around slightly and the top bar that holds the two screens together is slightly loose. However, overall, I really recommend this product. The performance is outstanding and is like new in ever other aspect.. Would buy again. Date published: 2017-01-30 Rated 5 out of 5 by missjif88 from My son loves the new 3DS. My son absolutely loves the New Nintendo 3DS. It runs great and the picture and 3d is awesome. Would definitely recommend this gaming unit to a friend. Date published: 2017-01-11 Rated 4 out of 5 by thatotherperson from A great buy It was defiantly cheaper to buy this as a bundle from here then to just buy the console from somewhere else. It arrived three days after I ordered it and the console and games work great. Mine did come with a charger but that charger didn't work so I had to go buy one but it was pretty cheap. Overall 9/10 would buy again as like a gift or something.
