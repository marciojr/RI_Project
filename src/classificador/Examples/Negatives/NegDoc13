Simply tilt and turn your Nintendo 3DS to solve challenging puzzles, outwit devious enemies, and escape intricate traps. Cubic Ninja places you in the role of CC, a brave little ninja with a distinctly cubic shape. The princess of your beloved kingdom - plus a few of your ninja friends -- has been abducted. And it's up to you to save them. To do so, you must tilt and turn your way through over 100 eye-opening levels, defeating adversaries such as Woofbot, Scorchbot, and more. From raging infernos to elemental forces of wind and water, your enemies will do whatever it takes to stop you. But you won't be stopped. If you have to tumble till you're dizzy, or survive raging waters just to rescue the princess, then you will. Because you're Cubic Ninja. And that's how you roll. " REVOLUTIONARY GAMEPLAY - Who needs buttons? Tilt and turn your Nintendo 3DS to guide Cubic Ninja through more than 100 challenging levels. Or simply use the Circle Pad. MASTER NINJUTSU SKILLS - Outwit cunning traps and rescue your fellow Ninjas by earning and unleashing mysterious Ninjutsu skills. CHALLENGE YOUR FRIENDS - Race through a level as quickly as you can, share a ghosted replay of your best run, and dare your friends to beat it. UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY - Create your own pulse-quickening levels and display them as a QR Code that can be shared with players all over the world.

Date published: 2016-11-29 Rated 4 out of 5 by powerKitten from Good to use, not to play. The game itself is a shovelware piece of garbage not worth your effort. What is worth your effort however is the homebrew you can play using this game. The 3ds has many homebrew developers that are making increasingly better games. The exploit using this game(ninjhax) has not been patched on any firmware. THIS CAN NOT BE USED FOR PIRACY. However, through HANS you can play homebrew and games from another region. Date published: 2015-11-12 Rated 5 out of 5 by Ninjhax from Game sucks. Badly. Ninjhax is the best thing ever One of the most terrible titles on the 3ds. This game serves one purpose: hacking to use homebrew. Homebrew runs a variety of different apps, many of which are super cool, plus you can use region locked games. Usually this game sells used for like 50 bucks, so if you can pick it up here, its a score. If going for the game itself and not ninjhax, do not waste your precious time and money. this game is the worst title on the 3ds by far. Ninjhax: 10/10 Cubic ninja: 0.4/10 Date published: 2015-10-18 Rated 4 out of 5 by NeonLemonLime from Give it a chance with the right mindset... If you're looking for some kind of hardcore game with lots of action, you're in the wrong place... by far. This game is more of an app-like game. If the Nintendo e-shop was out on the 3DS at the time of Cubic Ninja's release I'm almost certain it would have been there instead. I had a lot of fun playing it though. It was released pretty early in the 3DS's life so it was one of the first games I played that implemented the gyro controls. Cubic Ninja isn't going to win any game of the year awards or anything of that sort and I'm not sure its worth as much as it sells for but I had a good time with it. 3D couldn't be used much because using the gyro controls to tilt Cubic Ninja through the levels would have made the 3D a horrible idea. If you go into this game thinking you're going to be able to compare it to Ninja Gaiden or (insert favorite game name here) or something then you are going to have a bad time. You have to be thinking in the mindset of, "This game will be better than Temple Run or Angry Birds" or you will hate it. I thought the boss fights were fun and the game was very unique to the 3DS at the time. Probably not worth $15 but if you have a little brother or sister who likes ninjas but doesn't have the attention span to play long or very difficult games then I'd say it's perfect for them. All in all, people wouldn't hate it so much if it was on the e-shop with games like Pushmo or Crush3D instead of trying to pass itself off as a big game. When it's sitting on a shelf next to games like Ocarina of Time 3D and Kid Icarus: Uprising people tend to get the wrong idea about what Cubic Ninja really is. Date published: 2012-06-22 Rated 1 out of 5 by CaptIceman from Overpriced App Cubic Ninja has got to be the most boring game ever. This so called game should be an app cause its on reason for playing is to use the gyroscopic controls. If you are old enough do you remember the old wooden maze with a marble and two knobs well UbiSoft obviously does and thought this would make a good game for the 3DS only replace the marble with a cube and call it Cubic Ninja to make it sound interesting. Well it wears extremely thin after 5 minutes and becomes dull. Every time a new system comes out they go to UbiSoft for a filler game. UbiSoft became a joke cause most of their games stink. Date published: 2012-04-09 Rated 2 out of 5 by chinchillen from worst game ever Don't buy this game your just gonna waste you time and money it has the worst controls known to man. i had to move my 3ds in the most outrageous angles and its not something you want to do (you could possible drop you 3ds) I've tried using the analog stick to play it just made the game more frustrating than it had to be.it a shame because if it had the controls i'd imagine it should of have it would of been a great game ....but it just not . Date published: 2012-01-10 Rated 4 out of 5 by MrRating from A not so good game isn't that bad. This game isn't that bad it's a puzzle game any ways. So they made you slide across the screen or use the analog stick. Date published: 2011-07-22 Rated 4 out of 5 by RayTheUlitimateGamer from It isn't that bad. It's not that bad. I went on vacation for a week, and this was the game I bought. It lasted me the whole week, and the plane trip.
